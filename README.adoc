== Usage

1. Create an `inventory` file with the host(s) to configure.
1. Update `vars.yml` with relevant settings (e.g. `username` and `dotfiles_repo`)
1. Install roles with `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
1. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml` and provide sudo password.

Some packages require adding COPR repositories.
Be sure to add any required repositories to the list.

== Caveats

Currently, the RPMFusion keys are specific to Fedora 33.
Other versions will need to be updated in `rpmfusion_tasks.yml` based on URLs from https://rpmfusion.org/keys .
